I am a systems engineer focused on intranet deployments. Mainly I enjoy Unix
centric IT administration, low-level systems scripting, production systems
provisioning, configuration management, and working with hypervisors.

I also enjoy the DevOps landscape: working on continuous integration tools and
workflows, version control, backup schemes, and QA and monitoring tools. My
work also has me focusing on messaging middleware and queueing theory.
