I am a systems engineer that's played the part of system administrator, DevOps
engineer, developer, site reliability engineer, project manager, team lead, and
etc. I enjoy running and talking politics and philosophy. I've lived in Europe
and the US. Occasionally, I write something down in this blog.

[My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-coleman-0b366613/) is closer
to a résumé if you want to talk about projects or see a more complete skillset.

Eudaimonia is a definition of human fulfillment put forward by Aristotle. [The
School of Life does a good job presenting the
idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GocIobQ9MLs).
